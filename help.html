<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elden Ring mods are very in use just like how most applications or
    programs can be utilized in different ways for varying purposes. Some modes offer practical enhancements to the game
    state of your current character that a player is using the play the game. Some mods will make the game objectively
    more fun to breeze through with added features that make the game function more like traditional “hack n` slash”
    games. One issue with modding any game is the way in which it takes an extensive level of background knowledge to
    know how the computer system interacts with the game files themselves as well as how the game needs to be loaded in
    what order for the mods to work correctly. Here you&#39;ll discover everything from a new mechanic to explore,
    assistance for challenging bosses, even a method to pause the game without relying on a grace site, and many more!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind that experimenting with mods can be detrimental to
    integral system files on your computer so be very careful when rummaging through folders that you are not one
    hundred percent sure about. It would be truly horrible if you ended up deleting your save file that contains two
    hundred hours worth of play time on it. </p>
<h3 id="backup-save-file">Backup Save File</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you focus on modding in order to venture out into the “Lands
    Between” that expands the entirety of the game you will want to know where and how to find the save file location in
    your system&#39;s file explorer. Knowing where such a file is, is an important first step to modding the game
    because knowing exactly how to access this file will mitigate the amount of problems that arise from the
    modifications that are made to the game. Backing up this file once located is highly recommended as this assists in
    reverting back to the standard game state once you have had your fun modding if you wish to reinstate the original
    “vanilla” version of the game. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to navigate to the place where these integral files are
    stored, start looking in your “User” directory. On a Windows 10 based system you can start by clicking on the “This
    PC” button inside the file explorer. Once inside of the “This PC” folder there will be a folder that is normally at
    the highest level of importance inside whatever local data storage drive you are using. Generally in windows the
    most generic Drive that is used to store information is listed as the “C: [name of drive]”. When looking for the
    file that contains your save state in Elden Ring keep your eye out for the “User” folder. This generally contains
    other folders that relate to any program, files, or application that are used for a current user of the PC. Keep
    searching through the directories until you have traversed down this specific file path: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\EldenRing”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once here you will see files that are named with very random
    strings of numbers, this specific file is the one that contains the save state for Elden Ring and by clicking into
    this folder you will find either one file or multiple files that will end in .sl2 these files are the bytecodes for
    the save state of the game. Once you have access to this copy and paste it somewhere else for safekeeping in the
    future, just in case something goes awry. Ensuring you will have a clean save in case something gets corrupted. </p>
<h3 id="go-offline">Go Offline</h3>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you have done your due diligence and backed up your game
    in case a certain set of files were to become corrupted, you can start on your journey to modding your gaming
    experience. Before doing anything else at all we must set the setting of the game to run in offline mode. If you
    miss this step it is possible to be reported by the “anti-cheat” system that monitors the online status for hacking.
    This is due to the way in which the anti cheat script that is running concurrently to the games files assumes that
    you, the player, are cheating. Possibly resulting in getting a ban directed to your account that you play the game
    on, this ban could last for as little as 30 days or even 180 days. In order to boot the game in offline mode you
    must disable the “EasyAntiCheat” service. A ban will not result from disabling this in comparison to modding the
    game with the service running. Head to the location where you installed the game files for Elden ring, this will not
    be in your “Users” folder and will instead be in its own unique file path. Going through the game launcher, for
    example “Steam Launcher”, will make this process a lot simpler. Just find the game right click the game and go to
    the properties tab. Then in the properties tab you can find the “Local Files” tab, which will take you straight to
    the file path that the games source files are located at. The file path once found should look similar to:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“steam\steamapps\common\Elden Ring\game”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the file inside the folder path previously listed called,
    “start_protected_game.exe”, and then rename it to anything at all and add “.not” at the end. This will be listed as
    a NOT in the system and will enable the .exe from running. Next find the “elden_ring.exe” file and duplicate it.
    Rename that to “start_protected_game.exe” and load the game through the steam launcher as normal. You now will be
    unable to connect to multiplayer servers, meaning that you have disabled the anti-cheat service, disconnecting you
    from online services. To be sure of this a message will be displayed when launching the game that says, “Unable to
    start in online mode.”</p>
<h3 id="downloading-installing-a-mod-loader">Downloading/Installing a Mod Loader</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in order to get going with modding the game, you will want to
    head to a site that contains a download for the “Elden Ring Mod Loader”. This is a unique and powerful mod tool
    which is required to boot up many of the great mods that are available across the internet. Once you have downloaded
    the tool from Nexus Mods extract the folder to the folder location we found in the previous step for setting the
    game to launch in offline mode. The file path needed in this step is the same file path inside of the
    steamapps/common folder that was found in the previous step. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally you will need the files for the actual mods that you are
    going to want to implement. Going to the website that you downloaded the mod loader from you will be able to find a
    massive collection of different mods made by the wide community of players playing the game. Once the mods are
    downloaded that you would like to implement into the game, navigate back to where the mod loader is installed in
    your system files and you should now see another folder. You should now see another folder titled “mods”. No prizes
    for guessing what to do next. Drag the downloaded mod into that folder (you might need to extract it from a zipped
    file first). Simply return to steam after the previous step and then launch the game. All installed mods should
    load. If you want to remove a mod, simply delete its folder or file from the “mods” file.</p>

    <p>Elden Ring’s base multiplayer service can be tricky to use at times because it requires you to re-summon your

<pre><code>Are Mods Allowed <span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> Elden Ring?
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
    <p>To put it simply mods are allowed in elden ring however, Elden Ring uses an anti cheat called Easy Anti-cheat to
        protect against cheaters and Easy Anti-Cheat will detect modifications to the games files and could ban players
        who are found to have modified their files. This means to use mods you must play offline or you must read the
        mod page to see if the mod could get you banned when online.</p>
